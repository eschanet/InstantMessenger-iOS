\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{interface_f_i_r_storage_upload_task}{F\+I\+R\+Storage\+Upload\+Task} implements resumable uploads to a file in Firebase Storage. Uploads can be returned on completion with a completion callback, and can be monitored by attaching observers, or controlled by calling F\+I\+R\+Storage\+Task\+::pause, F\+I\+R\+Storage\+Task\+::resume, or F\+I\+R\+Storage\+Task\+::cancel. Uploads can take N\+S\+Data in memory, or an N\+S\+U\+R\+L to a file on disk. Uploads are performed on a background queue, and callbacks are raised on the developer specified callback\+Queue in \hyperlink{interface_f_i_r_storage}{F\+I\+R\+Storage}, or the main queue if left unspecified. Currently all uploads must be initiated and managed on the main queue.
