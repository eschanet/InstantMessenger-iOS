\item F\+I\+R\+Auth\+Error\+Code\+App\+Not\+Authorized -\/ Indicates the App is not authorized to use Firebase Authentication with the provided A\+P\+I Key. Go to the Google A\+P\+I Console and check under the credentials tab that the A\+P\+I key you are using has your application’s bundle I\+D whitelisted.
\item F\+I\+R\+Auth\+Error\+Code\+Keychain\+Error -\/ Indicates an error occurred while accessing the keychain. The N\+S\+Localized\+Failure\+Reason\+Error\+Key and N\+S\+Underlying\+Error\+Key fields in the N\+S\+Error.\+user\+Info dictionary will contain more information about the error encountered.
