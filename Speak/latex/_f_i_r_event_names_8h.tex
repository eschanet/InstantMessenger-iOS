\subsection{Detailed Description}
Predefined event names.

An Event is an important occurrence in your app that you want to measure. You can report up to 500 different types of Events per app and you can associate up to 25 unique parameters with each Event type. Some common events are suggested below, but you may also choose to specify custom Event types that are associated with your specific app. Each event type is identified by a unique name. Event names can be up to 32 characters long, may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (\char`\"{}\+\_\+\char`\"{}), and must start with an alphabetic character. The \char`\"{}firebase\+\_\+\char`\"{} prefix is reserved and should not be used.
